## Notes
- Terrabiomes is compatible with my other mod Redwood but it will interfere with the generation sometimes.

## About
Terrabiomes adds 10 new biomes, adding real life and fantasy biomes.

You can explore the **Maple forest**, the **Alpine Mmeadows**, the **Grasslands**, and the **Tropical Rainforest** if you want a new feel.

If you want something different, you can explore the fantasy biomes such as the **Twilight Forest** and the **Mountain Ruins**.

If you want to keep exploring minecraft-like biomes you can explore the biomes based on minecrafts existing biomes like the **Ice Swamp**, the **Fire Swamp**, the **Snowy Forest**, and the **Snowy Dark Forest**.

## Enjoy!
